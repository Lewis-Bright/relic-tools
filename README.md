# relic-tools

This is fork of the repo: https://dev.ibboard.co.uk/repos/RelicTools/TextureTool/ for ease of access via git. I have had no part (so far) in updating and maintaining this tool, so all of the great work has been performed by IBBoard.

At the moment, to get the build process to working, I am using Visual Studio to build it 

You should add a TextureToolPref.xml into the same folder as the build app so it runs properly (example can be found in `prefs` folder)
